    <h4>Personal Statement</h4>
    <p class='text-justify'>
      While pursuing my career, I have had the opportunity to work in diverse
      ecosystems, from the jungles of the upper Amazonian rainforest, the paramo
      of the Andes, the tropical dry forest of the Pacific coastal lowlands and
      the volcanic Galapagos Islands, to the Sonoran Desert. I was afforded
      these experiences because I come from one of the most megadiverse
      countries in the world, Ecuador.
    </p>
    <p class='text-justify'>
      Currently, I work for the Central Arizona Conservation Alliance – Desert
      Botanical Garden developing invasive species management plans for urban
      protected areas in Phoenix. In addition, I am creating a rare plant
      citizen science survey and monitoring protocols in a collaborative project
      between the Desert Botanical Garden and the Tonto National Forest.

    <h4> Super Quick... </h4>
    <p> I'm a young professional from Ecuador (now based in the Phoenix area) working for the environment. I'm passionate about preserving threatened ecosystems, getting our community involved with conservation efforts, and partnering with businesses, institutions, and government to achieve these goals.</p>
